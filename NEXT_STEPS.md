# üöÄ Next Steps: PEPEBALL Devnet Testing

## Your Action Plan

You now have everything you need to test PEPEBALL on devnet with 3-5 people. Here's exactly what to do next:

## Step 1: Find Your Testers (30 mins)

### Where to Find Testers
1. **Community Discord** - Post in your community channels
2. **Reddit** - r/solana, r/SolanaNFT, r/CryptoMoonShots
3. **Twitter** - Tweet asking for testers
4. **Telegram** - Solana ecosystem groups
5. **Friends** - Ask people you know in crypto

### How to Recruit
- Share `TESTER_INVITATION.md` in your channels
- Offer incentives (early access, rewards, recognition)
- Set clear expectations (3-5 days, 1-2 hours/day)
- Be enthusiastic and welcoming

## Step 2: Deploy to Devnet (30 mins)

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Run the setup script
bash setup-devnet.sh

# Build programs
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### Save Your Addresses
After deployment, save these program IDs:
- Token Program ID
- Lottery Program ID  
- LP Manager Program ID

You'll need these to configure the frontend and share with testers.

## Step 3: Configure Frontend for Devnet (15 mins)

Update `app/src/app.js`:
```javascript
// Line 8-12
this.programIds = {
    token: "YOUR_DEVNET_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID",
    lottery: "YOUR_DEVNET_LOTTERY_PROGRAM_ID",
    lpManager: "YOUR_DEVNET_LP_MANAGER_PROGRAM_ID"
};
```

Update connection to devnet in frontend:
- Set cluster to "devnet"
- Update RPC endpoint
- Test wallet connection

## Step 4: Onboard Testers (30 mins per tester)

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. Share these documents with each tester:
   - `DEVNET_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing guide
   - `TESTNET_CONFIGURATION.md` - Setup instructions
   - `TESTER_INVITATION.md` - Motivation and overview

2. Help testers:
   - Install Solana CLI and Anchor
   - Configure wallets for devnet
   - Get devnet SOL from faucet
   - Connect to test environment

3. Assign testing areas:
   - Tester 1: Basic token operations
   - Tester 2: Lottery entry system
   - Tester 3: Snapshot and winners
   - Tester 4: LP Manager
   - Tester 5: Security and edge cases

## Step 5: Testing Week Schedule

### Day 1: Setup (All testers)
- Install required tools
- Configure wallets
- Get devnet SOL
- Deploy contracts
- Basic connection testing

### Day 2: Basic Testing
- Token transfers
- Wallet connections
- Basic lottery entries
- Verify calculations

### Day 3-4: Advanced Testing
- Snapshot triggers
- Winner selection
- Payout distribution
- LP burns
- Security features

### Day 5: Final Review
- All testers submit findings
- Review bug reports
- Test fixes
- Final approval

## Step 6: Track Progress

### Create a Shared Tracker
Use Google Sheets or Notion to track:
- [ ] Tester assignments
- [ ] Completed tests
- [ ] Bugs found
- [ ] Fix status
- [ ] Tester feedback

### Communication Channels
Set up:
- Discord/Slack channel for testing
- Daily check-ins
- Bug report channel
- FAQ channel

## Step 7: Fix Bugs and Iterate

As bugs are reported:

1. **Log the bug** - Use your tracking system
2. **Fix the code** - Address the issue
3. **Test the fix** - Verify it works
4. **Redeploy** - Update devnet deployment
5. **Notify testers** - Request re-testing

### Bug Priority
- **Critical**: System crashes, fund loss, critical security issues
- **Major**: Major features broken, incorrect calculations
- **Minor**: Small bugs, UI issues
- **Cosmetic**: Styling, display issues

## Step 8: Post-Testing Actions

After testing is complete:

1. **Document Everything**
   - All bugs found and fixed
   - Tester feedback
   - Improvements made
   - Lessons learned

2. **Thank Your Testers**
   - Personal messages
   - List contributors
   - Offer rewards
   - Invite to launch

3. **Prepare for Mainnet**
   - Address all critical bugs
   - Run security review (recommended)
   - Final testing pass
   - Launch strategy
