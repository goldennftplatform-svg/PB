## 📋 Next Steps to Deploy

To deploy PEPEBALL to devnet, you need to:

### 1. Install Solana CLI (Required)
```powershell
# Method 1: Download from Solana website
# Go to: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
# Download and install

# Method 2: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
wsl
curl https://release.solana.com/stable/install -o solana-install.sh
sh solana-install.sh
```

### 2. Install Anchor CLI (Required)
```powershell
npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli
```

### 3. Deploy to Devnet
```powershell
# Once Solana and Anchor are installed:
cd C:\Users\PreSafu\Desktop\POWERsol
.\deploy-devnet.ps1

# OR manually:
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### 4. Get Your Program IDs
After deployment, program IDs will be in:
- `target/deploy/pepball_token-keypair.json`
- `target/deploy/lottery-keypair.json`
- `target/deploy/lp_manager-keypair.json`

### 5. Update Configuration
The deployment script will create a `DEVNET_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.txt` with all IDs.
Update `Anchor.toml` and `app/src/app.js` with the actual IDs from the summary.
