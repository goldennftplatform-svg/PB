# 🔒 Security Fix - Secrets Removed

## What Happened
Secrets/keys were accidentally committed to GitHub. They have been removed.

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ `.gitignore` properly configured
- ✅ Secrets files should be ignored
- ✅ Test wallets are in `.gitignore`

## 🔧 If Secrets Were Committed

### 1. Remove from Git History (if needed)
```bash
# Remove file from all history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch SECRETS.md" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (WARNING: This rewrites history)
git push origin --force --all
```

### 2. Rotate Any Exposed Keys
- If any keys were exposed, **ROTATE THEM IMMEDIATELY**
- Generate new keys
- Update deployments with new keys

### 3. Verify .gitignore
Make sure these are in `.gitignore`:
```
SECRETS.md
**/secrets/**
**/*.key
*.keypair
*.secret
test-wallets/**/*.json
wallet-backups/**/*.json
```

## 🚨 Important
The build error is **NOT related to secrets**. It's a Rust/Anchor build issue.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Secrets removed from repo
2. ⏭️ Fix build error (separate issue)
3. ⏭️ Test program (works without IDL)
