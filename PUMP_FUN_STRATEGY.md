# üê∏ PEPEBALL Pump.Fun Launch Strategy

## The Challenge: Pump.Fun Price Dynamics

**Problem**: Pump.Fun starts with ~5M tokens for $20, but we want 1M tokens = $20 for qualification.

**Solution**: Dynamic qualification system that adapts to market price!

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Launch (Pump.Fun)
- **Starting Price**: ~$0.000004 per token (5M tokens = $20)
- **Qualification**: Hold 5M tokens minimum ($20 USD value)
- **Marketing**: "Buy 5M PEPE = $20 to qualify for lottery!"

### Phase 2: Price Discovery
- **Target Price**: $0.000020 per token (1M tokens = $20)
- **Qualification**: Automatically adjusts to maintain $20 USD minimum
- **Marketing**: "Qualification adjusts with price - always $20 minimum!"

### Phase 3: Mature Market
- **Stable Price**: $0.000020+ per token
- **Qualification**: 1M tokens = $20 USD
- **Marketing**: "Hold 1M PEPE tokens to qualify!"

## Dynamic Qualification Logic

```javascript
// Real-time qualification calculation
function calculateQualification() {
    const currentPrice = getTokenPrice(); // From DEX
    const qualifyUSD = 20.00; // Always $20 minimum
    const requiredTokens = Math.ceil(qualifyUSD / currentPrice);
    
    // Update UI dynamically
    updateQualificationDisplay(requiredTokens);
}
```

## Marketing Messages by Phase

### Phase 2 (Growth)

### Phase 3 (Mature)
