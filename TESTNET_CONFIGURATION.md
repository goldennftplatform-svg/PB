# üåê Testnet Configuration for PEPEBALL

## Quick Setup for Testers

Share this document with your 3-5 testers to get them started quickly.

## 1. Initial Setup (Do This First)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
cd POWERsol

# Install dependencies
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

## 2. Configure Solana for Devnet

```bash
# Set to devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Verify connection
solana config get

# Request SOL (repeat if needed)
solana airdrop 2
```

## 3. Configure Phantom Wallet for Devnet

1. Open Phantom wallet
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Developer Mode
3. Enable "Test Mode"
4. Add devnet network
5. Fund with devnet SOL from faucet

Or use the CLI:
```bash
# Get your wallet address
solana address

# Request airdrop
solana airdrop 2 YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

# Check balance
solana balance
```

## 4. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the programs
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

## 5. Get Your Deployment Addresses

After deployment, you'll get addresses like:
```
Deploying program: target/deploy/pepball_token.so
Program Id: PEPEBALL111111111111111111111111111111111111

Deploying program: target/deploy/lottery.so
Program Id: LOTTERY111111111111111111111111111111111111

Deploying program: target/deploy/lp_manager.so
Program Id: LPMANAGER111111111111111111111111111111111
```

**Save these addresses!** You'll need them for testing.

## 6. Configuration Files

### Update Anchor.toml

The `Anchor.toml` should have these entries for devnet:

```toml
[programs.devnet]
pepball_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID"
lottery = "YOUR_LOTTERY_PROGRAM_ID"
lp_manager = "YOUR_LP_MANAGER_PROGRAM_ID"
```

### Update Frontend (app/src/app.js)

```javascript
// Line 8-12: Update with your program IDs
this.programIds = {
    token: "YOUR_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID",
    lottery: "YOUR_LOTTERY_PROGRAM_ID",
    lpManager: "YOUR_LP_MANAGER_PROGRAM_ID"
};
```
